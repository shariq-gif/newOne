{`This is the day the world got its funniest, smartest, blankiest girl.
The girl who zones out mid-sentence, rolls her eyes at humans, and still somehow chose me (clearly glitch in the matrix).

Anushka, the girl who has entire dogs jumping around her, but barely trusts people.
The girl who moans at Garv (don't deny it) but melts when I send a voice note.
The one who sent me her photo dump and made my heart skip entire beats.
Who called me “pookie” so many times, now even Spotify feels jealous.
You really are every mood swing wrapped in a blanket.

But hey, you're not just chaos and cute violence.
You're the girl who grew up adjusting herself for everyone,
the girl her dad cried for at every goodbye,
the girl who called herself “quiet” but carries entire universes in her thoughts.
You're smart—like scary smart. Funny in ways only I seem to catch.
And beneath that cold front? A warm, soft, too-good heart.
Mine now.

I don't know how I got lucky enough to be the one you're weird with, emotional with, numb with, dramatic with, sleepy with, flirty with, sad with—and still with.
So today, I don't just celebrate your birthday,
I celebrate you.

The girl who made late-night chats, Schrodinger nights.
The girl who made a simple “pookie” sound like home.

So happy birthday, my strange, sweet, sleepy, soulful girl.
Here's to a year full of coffee, chaos, and maybe (just maybe)... those plushies.

I love you. Like a lot. Always.
— Yours,
Pookie.`}
